# Sorting algorithms and Big O

Soting algorithms is a step by step process which puts a list of disordered elements in numerical or lexicographical order, and either descending or ascending. A sorting algorithm must be efficient in sorting inputs. Sorting is also often useful in canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable input.  

The Output of a sorting algorithm must satisfy the following conditions:
1. The outputs must be monotonic
2. The output is a permutation

## Classification
Sorting algorithms can be classified by:
1. Computational complexity: Best case, Average case and Worst case behaviors in terms of the size of input. In general, good algorithms should be in the order of O(nlogn) while bad algorithms should be in the order of O(n^2).
2. Memory usage: some sorting algrithms are "in-place" which means they are in the order of O(1)
3. Recursion: some algorithms are either recursive or non-recursive, while others may be both
4. Stability: Some sorting algorithms maintain relative order of records with equal keys (i,e values)
